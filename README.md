###### vizag

One of the oldest port cities of India, Vizag is located at the heart of Andhra Pradesh. **The city got its name from Lord Visakheswara Temple which is now located beneath the seawaters**. The place is famous for the picturesque landscapes and serene beaches which makes it one of the liked places to visit for coastal vacations. The places I like in vizag are: 

**Araku Valley**

**Borra Caves**

**Katiki Waterfalls**

**RK Beach**
